*I am currently embracing an exhilarating journey as an AI Investor at IDG Capital, where since August 2022, I have been nurturing advancements in domains like Generative AI, Autonomous Driving, Robotics, Large Language Models, and their associated supply chains and applications. My primary focus is on fostering innovation and driving the surge of technology to new frontiers.*

Prior to my current role, I was the Founder of [ADLab](https://pjlab-adg.github.io/) @ [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn). I built a research team consisting of 40+ talented researchers and interns aiming at revolutionizing the transportation system in a data-driven way.

Before that, I worked as Deputy Director of R&D at [Sensetime Technology Ltd](http://www.sensetime.com/), leading a product team containing over 30 talented engineers and product specialists, developing the RoboX Autonomous Products, including RoboBus & RoboSweeper. 

In May 2020, I acquired my Ph.D. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong under the esteemed guidance of Professors [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/) and [Xiaoou Tang](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/xotang.shtml).  I got my bachelor's degrees of Electronic Engineering and Economics in *Tsinghua University* in 2016. During my doctoral years, I garnered invaluable experience working as a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and Meta Reality Labs (formerly Facebook Reality Labs).

**Research Interests:** My academic pursuits gravitate towards 3D Scene Reconstruction, 3D Scene Perception, Behaviour & Scene Simulation, and an extensive range of topics related to Autonomous Driving.
