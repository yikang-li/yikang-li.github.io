LI Yikang is a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Multi-Media Lab (MMLab), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/) and Prof. [Xiaoou Tang](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/xotang.shtml). He got his bachelor's degrees of Electronic Engineering and Economics in Tsinghua University in 2016. His research interests include but not limit to Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Natureal Language Processing, and Robotics.

**Yikang has started working as a senior research manager since Early 2019 in Mobile Intelligence Group (MIG) of Sensetime.**
Before that, he has worked with [Lu Yuan](http://www.lyuan.org/) (2014~2015) and [Nan Duan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nanduan/) (2017) at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), and [Chris Twigg](http://chris.twi.gg/) (2018) at Facebook Reality Labs (FRL). He also has a close research collaboration with [Bolei Zhou](http://people.csail.mit.edu/bzhou/), [Jianping Shi](http://shijianping.me/) and [Xiao Chu](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xchu/).

Yikang is an energetic and passinate researcher who loves travelling and photography. He is also a Marathon runner. Please feel free to contact him if you have any similar interests.

Detailed RESUME ([Engilish version](pdf/resume.pdf) and [Chinese version](pdf/resume-zh_CN.pdf)) is attached.

I'm currently a research scientist at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](http://www.shlab.org.cn/) and Deputy Director of R&D at [Sensetime Technology Ltd.](http://www.sensetime.com/). I obtained my Ph.D. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in May, 2020 supervised by Prof. [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/) and Prof. [Xiaoou Tang](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/xotang.shtml). I got my bachelor's degrees of Electronic Engineering and Economics in Tsinghua University in 2016. I worked as an research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) during my Ph.D. years. 

Research interest: 3D Scene Reconstruction, 3D Scene Perception, Behavior & Scene Simulation, and, any Autonomous-Driving-related topics. *Never stop looking for highly self-motivated students for internship or collaboration.*

<!-- ### Highlights

1. Four of my papers are highly cited and ranked top 20 globally in recent 5 years in Google scholar metrics! See [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/421192644).
2. I wrote a popular book [迁移学习导论](http://jd92.wang/tlbook) to make it easy to learn, understand, and use transfer learning.
3. I lead the most popular transfer learning and semi-supervised learning projects on Github: [Transfer learning repo](https://github/jindongwang/transferlearning) [![Transfer learning repo](/assets/img/transferlearning-repo-star.jpg)](https://github/jindongwang/transferlearning) and  [Semi-supervised learning repo](https://github/torchssl/torchssl) [![SSL repo](/assets/img/torchssl-star.jpg)](https://github/stars/torchssl/torchssl)
