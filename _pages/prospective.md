## Join DELTA Lab

I am actively recruiting **PhD students**, **research interns**, and **engineers** to join DELTA Lab at Shanghai Innovation Institute. We focus on using AI and data to solve real-world decision-making problems.

---

## Research Directions

Our lab works on the intersection of **AI, Data, and Decision Making**:

- **Collective Intelligence**: Scalable human-in-the-loop data annotation methods to enhance AI capabilities
- **Event Perception & Forecasting**: AI-powered global event perception and prediction systems
- **Data-driven Decision Systems**: Applying ML models to improve decision-making in various domains

---

## What I'm Looking For

### Ideal Candidates

I value **execution ability** and **curiosity** over traditional metrics. The ideal candidate:

- Has strong programming skills (language doesn't matter)
- Is genuinely curious about data, AI, or decision-making
- Has hands-on project experience (scale doesn't matter)
- Is comfortable with "learning by doing"
- Can work independently while being a good team player

### What Matters Less

- Perfect GPA (though academic foundation helps)
- Existing publications (nice to have, not required)
- Specific technical background (we welcome cross-disciplinary candidates)

## What You'll Get

### Training Philosophy

My training philosophy emphasizes **practice over theory**:

- **Real Projects**: Everyone works on real data and real problems
- **Engineering Skills**: Git, Docker, cloud services, databases - these are fundamentals
- **Full-stack Data Awareness**: From data collection, cleaning, to analysis
- **Collaboration**: Code reviews, documentation, teamwork

### Resources

- Adequate computing resources (GPU clusters)
- Research funding for conferences and collaborations
- Small team = more personal attention
- Access to industry connections (VC, startups, tech companies)

### Career Paths

Our alumni pursue diverse careers:
- Academia (research positions)
- Industry (AI/ML engineers, data scientists)
- Startups (founders, early employees)
- Finance (quant researchers)

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need publications to apply?**
A: No. Hands-on experience and genuine interest matter more than publication count.

**Q: What's the typical PhD duration?**
A: Depends on your home university's policy (typically 4-5 years in China).

**Q: Can international students apply?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to meet the admission requirements of the partnering Chinese universities.

**Q: What programming languages should I know?**
A: Python is most common in our lab, but we care more about your ability to learn than your current stack.
